Our team Vibrio vibrante won the National Competition of Microbiological Collections and Molecular Genetics (CoNaCoM 2020) with the Phycoil Project. The project consisted in a structured plan to use the Brazilian strain Chlorella sorokiniana 311-32 (Chlorophyceae: Chlorophyta) transformed with pCAMBIA1303-ZEPP::GmDof4::GmDof11 after nuclear sta6 deletion through the deletion cassette in pGreen0029-Δsta6::cat. This molecular reprogramming of starch/triacylglycerol metabolism enhances the microalga oil yield, thus enhancing green biofuel production in biorefineries.
