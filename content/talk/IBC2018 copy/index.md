Since my abstract submitted to the VII RBCC was selected as one of the most relevant, I was invited to participate in the thematic roundtable titled "New cytogenomics technologies for detection and characterization of variants in the human genome" presenting my study "Selection of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia-associated SNPs from public GWAS databases reveal potential lncRNA regions for Brazilian population association studies".

The roundtable discussion was mediated by Dr. Társis Vieira and it was composed of Dr. Carla Rosenberg, Dr. Juliana Mazzeu, Dr. André Rodrigueiro and me.
