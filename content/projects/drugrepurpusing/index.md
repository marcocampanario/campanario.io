## Summary

Microalgae produce various economically valuable compounds, such as oils and antioxidant pigments, which are used for different purposes such as human nutrition and biofuel production. In order to understand the metabolism of these compounds and assist future research with green microalgae, the aim of the project was to improve an efficient genetic transformation system for green and brown microalgae.

The project was a collaboration between the Laboratory of Microbial Genetics (LabGeM-UFPR), the Center for Research and Development of Self-Sustaining Energy (NPDEAS-UFPR) and the Carlos Chagas Institute (ICC-Fiocruz).
