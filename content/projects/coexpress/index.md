## Summary

Epifania Dance Project is a dance company directed by Guiga de Souza that seeks to praise art through the movements and senses. The company's main objective is to create a space where people can connect with themselves and the art of dance, exploring their emotions and sensations through movement. With a strong focus on urban dances (i.e. waacking, hip-hop and popping), Epifania brings together dancers from different backgrounds and experiences to create innovative and thought-provoking performances that aim to inspire and elevate the audience's artistic appreciation. Through their work, the group promotes the transformative power of dance, encouraging audiences to engage with the art form in new and exciting ways.
