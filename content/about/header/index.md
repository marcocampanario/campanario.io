<!-- this is a subheadline -->

Currently, I am a **Biological Sciences Undergrad** at the [**Federal University of Paraná**](https://www.ufpr.br/) and a **CNPq Scientific Initiation Intern** at the **Laboratory of Human Cytogenetics and Oncogenetic ([LabCHO](https://linktr.ee/Labcho.ufpr))** \@ [Erastinho Oncopediatric Hospital](https://https://www.erastinho.com.br/). I'm mostly interested in Bioinformatics, Molecular Biology and Evolution.

During the whole undergraduate time, I was involved in several research projects, and received awards for the best undergraduate research and outstanding academic performance. I am a **Freshman Award** laureate by the National Institute of Educational Studies and Research Anísio Teixeira (Inep) and the Organization of Ibero-American States for Education, Science and Culture (OEI). I also received the awards for **Best Research**, **Best Design**, **Best Technique** and **1st Place** at the National Competition of Microbiological Collections and Molecular Genetics (CoNaCoM 2020) and **Best Research** at the Brazilian Congress of Molecular Biology (ConBraMol 2020) and other scientific events.

I have already worked with **Microalgal Genetics** (i. e. microalgal biomass enhancement for biofuel production, micro- and macroscale green microalgae and diatom cultivation and cell transformation), with **Biology and Science Teaching** (such as the development of educational games on Genetics and Evolution), and with **Cancer-regulating lncRNAs** (for example, leukemia-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in lncRNAs on Brazilian populations).

I am also part of a professional dance company (**Epifania Dance Project**) directed by the genious and inspiring choreographer Guiga de Souza. I participated in big dance events such as *FIH2* (Curitiba - PR), *RioH2K* (Rio de Janeiro - RJ) and *O Movimento* (Maringá - PR).
