<!-- this is a subheadline -->

Currently, I am a **Biological Sciences Undergrad** at the [**Federal University of Paraná**](https://www.ufpr.br/) and a **CNPq Scientific Initiation Intern** at the **Laboratory of Human Cytogenetics and Oncogenetic ([LabCHO](https://linktr.ee/Labcho.ufpr))** \@ [Erastinho Oncopediatric Hospital](https://https://www.erastinho.com.br/). I'm mostly interested in Bioinformatics, Molecular Biology and Evolution.

During the whole undergraduate time, I was involved in research and received awards for the best undergraduate research and outstanding academic performance. While on my Bachelor, I have already worked with **microalgal genetics** (green microalgal biomass enhancement for biofuel production), **Biology and Science teaching** (development of educational games on Genetics and Evolution), and with **lncRNAs on cancer**.
