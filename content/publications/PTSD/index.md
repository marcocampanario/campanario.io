# Abstract

The nosographic structure of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) remains unclear, and attempts to determine its symptomatic organization have been unsatisfactory. Several explanations have been suggested, and the impact of trauma type is receiving increasing attention. As little is known about the differential impact trauma type in the nosographic structure of PTSD, we explored the nosology of PTSD and the effect of trauma type on its symptomatic organization. We reanalyzed five cross-sectional psychopathological networks involving different trauma types, encompassing a broad range of traumatic events in veterans, war-related trauma in veterans, sexual abuse, terrorist attacks, and various traumatic events in refugees. The weighted topological overlap was used to estimate the networks and attribute weights to their links. Coexpression differential network analysis was used to identify the common and specific network structures of the connections across different trauma types and to determine the importance of symptoms across the networks. We found a set of symptoms with more common connections with other symptoms, suggesting that these might constitute the prototypical nosographic structure of PTSD. We also found a set of symptoms that had a high number of specific connections with other symptoms; these connections varied according to trauma type. The importance of symptoms across the common and specific networks was ascertained. The present findings offer new insights into the symptomatic organization of PTSD and support previous research on the impact of trauma type on the nosology of this disorder.
